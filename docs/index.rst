AI Data Rescue: Daily Precipitation
===================================

Can we use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to rapidly transcribe vital climate data from paper archives? 

Datasets of historical weather observations are vital to our understanding of climate change and variability, and improving those datasets means transcribing millions of observations - converting paper records into a digital form. Doing such transcription manually is `expensive and slow <http://brohan.org/transcription_methods_review/>`_, and we have a backlog of millions of pages of potentially valuable records which have never been transcribed. We would dearly like a cheap, fast, software tool for extracting weather observations from (photographs of) archived paper documents. Can modern multimodal large language models be that tool?
